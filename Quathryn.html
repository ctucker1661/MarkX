<p> &emsp; &emsp; Catherine is new to computer programming and app development, but she's here to play. 
Her unique background of creative writing and study of rhetorical strategies brings a colorful perspective to the otherwise lackluster world of computer scientists. 
On our current project, a mobile app called Mark X, Catherine provided the foundational idea for the app, and also wrote out the entire description of the app as viewable on the Windows app store, as her writing prowess was legendary around the office. 
She will graduate from Whitworth University this May with a Bachelor of Arts in English. 
Her career with Pard Nur will probably be rather short, yet she anticipates it will be very rewarding. 
From here she plans on working in the publishing industry, writing novels of her own in her spare time. 
In the meantime, in addition to working with us at Pard Nur, she also works as a waitress at a local sushi bar and as a peer writing consultant in her university's Composition Commons.
Also, she is actively involved with the literary magazine <i> Rock and Sling, </i> published from Whitworth University, as an editorial assistant.
Her hobbies include reading, mostly; any classics she can get her hands on.
She is also a travel enthusiast.
She has travelled to France, Italy, Ireland, and returned from a month-long trip to London only at the end of January 2016. 
And most importantly, her favorite color is orange and her favorite animal is the giraffe.</p>
