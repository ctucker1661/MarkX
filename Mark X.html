<h2 style="text-align:center;">A Locating and Tracking App.</h2>
<h3>Created by Catherine Tucker and Ian Stenerson</h3>
<p> <b>Description:</b> We have designed a mobile application for finding, saving, and sharing specific noteworthy locations. 
A map of your immediate area is displayed, and from there you can place a point, or an "X," upon a spot you need to remember, 
be it where you parked your car, the best diner for breakfast you've ever been to, or a quirky gas station in the shape of a 
cowboy hat. If you consider the location interesting and think others would as well, this is the app for you. </p>
<p>
It will be composed of three categories: Personal, Shared With Me, and Community. Personal will be used for locations only 
relevant to you, may this be where your car is parked, where your hotel is in a foreign land, or that shawarma restaurant you 
saw on 5th Avenue you aren't craving now but want to try later. Shared With Me will be specifically for recommendations from 
friends that you have added on the app. Perhaps your friends found a cafe with the best hazelnut latte they've ever had, or are
 trying to point you to exactly where your rendezvous point is when you have plans to meet up. The large, overarching category 
 is the Community map where anybody can place a pin and recommend it to the general population. The versatility of the three tabs
 allows the app to be useful for anybody, whether they are prone to lose things or get lost and would need the Personal tab or
 are simply interested in making an obscure but worthwhile venue more popular via the Community tab.
